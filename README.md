A little program I made over a year ago to download videos from YouTube.

Don't expect good code here btw.

## Usage
- Type in your queries when the program starts or load them from file<br>
You can hold DELETE to erase all existing links.

- After all videos load, check them.<br>
Press "Change video" to change the video to another one found while searching. <br>
Press "Open in browser" to open the video in browser.

- After checking, you can edit the download settings.<br>
Press on one of the available file types to change it.<br>
Press on the file path to select a new one.

- After continuing, the videos will be saved to the selected file path.<br>
Then you can redownload videos or open the folder in explorer.
